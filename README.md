# codealpha_portfolio_task_3
My portfolio project consists of an HTML file (index.html) for the website structure, a CSS file (portfolio.css) for styling, and a JavaScript file (script.js) for interactive features like menu toggle and tab switching. The images folder contains profile pictures and portfolio thumbnails. A CV file (Karisni_CV.pdf) is available for download. The design is responsive, displaying a horizontal menu on larger screens and a vertical layout on smaller screens. The website includes Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact sections, providing a clean and interactive showcase of your skills. ðŸš€
